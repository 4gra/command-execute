{"name":"Command-execute","tagline":"Simple command execution plugin for Pidgin and Finch","body":"# Readme\r\n## What?\r\nCommand-execute is a plugin for Pidgin and Finch which lets you execute a command on either every new IM received or on every conversation update.\r\n\r\nA conversation update is triggered everytime a message is received which you did not see yet. For example that applies for messages which occur in a window which is in the background in Finch.\r\n## How?\r\nJust put the `command-execute.so` into your Pidgin/Finch plugins folder.\r\nNormally this is `~/.purple/plugins/`.\r\n\r\nIf this does not work for you, you maybe have to compile the plugin yourself:\r\n\r\n```gcc command-execute.c -O2 -Wall -fpic `pkg-config --cflags glib-2.0` -I/path/to/headers -shared -o command-execute.so```\r\n\r\nYou have to replace `/path/to/headers` with the path to the libpurple header files.\r\n## Why?\r\nI wrote this plugin because non of the existing command execution plugins worked for Pidgin _and_ Finch.\r\n","google":"UA-40657695-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
